# odin-recipes
Recipe project from The Odin Project

This is going to be the first project for The Odin Project, where I will 
make a simple website with pages linking to recipes. The goal of this 
project is just to see how pages work, how you link them to eachother
and how you show images and lists on these pages. The goal is not to
make a pretty website and CSS will not be used.
